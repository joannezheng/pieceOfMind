# pieceOfMind

Piece of Mind is a personal, portable, and prevention-based concussion test that is independently stored within a wireless Arduino Uno. Users will traverse through pre-loaded SCAT tests to monitor patient status, and can use a Matlab script to compare data trends over time. This will help track healing or the possibility of "sub-concussions" which may not be detected with a one-time physician exam, and allow more at-home monitoring.
